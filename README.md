## My process

Find the html structure, I usually prefer to draw it on paper, then after that I'm filling the html elements with the basic content that don't need any manipulations. After CSS comes to add styles and re-arrange the layout to make it look like the design. Of course everything is built with mobile first process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

Having rem units in padding and margin is useful when the content isnt overflowing even in mobile screen size, but if it's the case just use a media query where I set the font-size of the root element lower, or maybe use percentages where it will automatically re-size.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
### Continued development

Still training with flexbox even though I know how to use it, but I'll try more complex layouts to see how far I can go with it.
I also want to improve with box-sizing: border-box as it behaves differently than the default setting (content-box).
